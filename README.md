# project idea
Adding new records, listing them, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application (as shown in the main menu screenshot below).
# Functions of the phonebook
## 1-Add informations of contacts:
we make a function that ask the user to enter the numbers of contacts which he need to add to the phonebook
then we ask user to enter the name followed by the number , this data will be saved to the arrays (list)
